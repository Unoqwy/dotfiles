# discord-bell

This Discord modification binds to a notification bell inside xmobar.
The bell appears when Discord starts and goes away when Discord closes.

## How it works

As the patching method used doesn't give access to the internal flux state of the app, the script works by reading the HTML document itself every 10 seconds.

## Not compatible at all

This hasn't been designed with compatibility in mind, it's most likely incompatible with other "mod loaders". This isn't a problem for me tho as I'm not using any of these mods.
